# Privacy Policy

## Information We Collect
- This extension does not collect, store, or share any personal information. It operates entirely within your browser and does not send any data to external servers.

## How We Use Permissions
- storage: Used only to remember user preferences (e.g., whether Ugly Mode is enabled or disabled).
- host_permissions (facebook.com): Required to apply custom styles to Facebook’s UI.
- scripting: Used to inject or remove CSS dynamically when toggling Ugly Mode.

No user data is accessed, collected, or transmitted.

## Data Sharing
We do not share any data because this extension does not collect any.

## Changes to This Policy
If any changes are made to this privacy policy, they will be reflected in the extension’s description on the Chrome Web Store.

If you have any questions about this privacy policy, feel free to contact us via the Chrome Web Store support page.
